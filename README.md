# Do we have to be more prepared during rainy seasons?

## Project Background 

This is the first graded project, as part of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive (Flex) course. 

## Problem Statement

In the recent years, Covid-19 has been the focus of our lives. Besides the normal hygeniene precautions, we have been asked to be more vigilant during the rainy season to prepare for the spike in cases. How true would that be? We will find out

The purpose of the study is to find out whether flu cases are more prevalent during rainy seasons.
